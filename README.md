# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @MiguelAngelHorta, Senior GRC Engineer
- 👀 I’m interested in managing information security governance risk & compliance programs by leveraging automation and data engineering concepts to parse, transform, and report on data.
- 🧘 My focus lies in architecting process workflows that contribute to a proactive security posture. 
- 🌱 My experience pertains to identifying areas for improvements in a security program and designing governance reporting.
- ☁️ Lately, my curiosity has been captivated by cloud technologies, distributed systems, application building, and configuring workflows.
- 🧑‍💻 Most of the scripts I've worked with are in SQL, Javascript, and Advanced Excel formulas.
